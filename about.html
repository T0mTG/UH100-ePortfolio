            <div class="valueContent">I love to create. When I was young, I used to spent countless hour building Lego from blueprints created in my head. Growing up, those blueprints never fade away, they shifted into different forms: Minecraft at 12, photography at 16, and now, programming. This website, for instance, is one of my creations.</div>

            <div class="introContent">“May the Force be with you”, an iconic phrase resonating across the Star Wars universe, seems to be just fiction to us. Well, I do not think so, I believe that we do possess the same thing, it’s called hope. It’s the quiet strength that endure even in the darkest time. It’s my belief that humanity choose kindness despite so many ongoing setbacks and wrong-doings. In every act of compassion, every conversations, … no matter how insignificant it might seems, kindness is spread and hope take root. Be kind and may hope prosper.</div>

            <div class="valueContent">I believe my strengths lie in my ability to quickly learn new concepts, my creativity in problem-solving, and my strong foundation in data structures and algorithms. I am currently honing these skills by practicing problems on Leetcode daily. Moreover, I’m teaching myself in full-stack web development using industry standard framework like NextJS, Django, … This e-portfolio, as evidence toward my progress, is my first stepping stone. Besides, my plan of personal leverage also consists of going headfirst into any opportunities, be it any Hackathon or a research mentee. I’m not stopping anytime soon.</div>
