# UH100-ePortfolio
An e-portfolio page for my UH100 class at UA
The assignment was to build a website using Wix, but I'm a CS major, freshman at the time, so why not code it :D.
At the time of coding, I had forgotten how to code a plain HTML, Js and CSS website. The project was due at the end of 11/17/24, and I had started this on 11/13/24. Let's build this!
